std::cin.get();
-  is used to read a single character from standard input (usually the keyboard)
- is often used to pause the program and wait for the user to press Enter (or another key) before the program \
continues. Since it waits for input, it effectively pauses program execution until the user provides input.

- Literals -> n C++, literals are fixed values that are written directly into the code. \
They represent constant values of various types and don’t require any computation to determine their value. \
C++ provides literals for basic data types, like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and booleans.
