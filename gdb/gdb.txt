✅ CMake

A build system generator

Writes your build configuration

Produces Makefiles / Ninja files / VS projects

Does NOT compile code by itself

Helps organize large projects

✅ Make / Makefile

A build tool

Compiles your source files

Uses compiler commands (g++, clang++)

Reads rules you write manually

Runs commands like:

g++ -c main.cpp
g++ main.o -o app

🟥 GDB

GDB is neither a build system nor a build tool.

GDB is a debugger.

It lets you examine your program while it is running or crashed.

You use it to:

Run your program step by step

Set breakpoints

See variable values

Inspect memory/registers

Debug segmentation faults

Backtrace crashes

Watch variable changes

Debug multi-threaded programs

Debug optimized code

Example commands:

gdb ./app
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) next
(gdb) print x
(gdb) backtrace

🧠 How all three fit together

Here is the workflow:

1️⃣ CMake

Generates Makefiles automatically.

2️⃣ Makefile (Make)

Compiles your code into an executable.

3️⃣ GDB

Debugs the executable.

1. Starting GDB
Start GDB with your program
gdb ./myprogram

Run the program
run          # or just 'r'


If your program needs arguments:

run arg1 arg2

🟥 2. Breakpoints (stopping points)
Set a breakpoint at the beginning of main
break main

Set a breakpoint at a specific line
break file.cpp:25

Set a breakpoint on a function
break myFunction

List all breakpoints
info breakpoints

Delete a breakpoint
delete 1    # 1 = breakpoint number

🟩 3. Running & Stepping

When the program stops at a breakpoint:

Step line-by-line (enter functions)
step        # or 's'

Next line (skip function bodies)
next        # or 'n'

Continue until next breakpoint
continue    # or 'c'

Finish current function
finish

🟨 4. Inspecting Variables
Print the value of a variable
print x       # or 'p x'

Print a pointer’s content
print *ptr

Print a C++ object’s fields
print myObj

Print with formatting
print/x x     # print hex
print/d x     # print decimal
print/t x     # print binary

🟪 5. Inspecting Execution State
Get a stack trace (very important for crashes)
backtrace        # or 'bt'


Shows which function calls led to the crash.

Go to a specific frame in the stack
frame 2         # frame number

Show all local variables in the current frame
info locals

Show function arguments
info args

🟫 6. Watching variables (automatic stop when changed)
Stop the program when a variable changes
watch x

Stop when memory at an address changes
watch *ptr

🟧 7. Memory and Assembly (optional unless needed)
Examine raw memory
x/10xw 0x7fff1234    # 10 words in hex


Syntax:

x / number format size address


Format examples:

x = hex

d = decimal

s = string

Size examples:

b = byte

h = halfword

w = word

g = giant

🟫 8. Controlling the Program
Quit GDB
quit        # or 'q'

Restart the program
run

⚙️ 9. Compile with debug symbols (important)

To use GDB properly, compile your code with -g:

g++ -g main.cpp -o app


Or in CMake:

set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)

🧠 Most Important Commands (quick recap)
Purpose	Command
Start program	run
Set breakpoint	break
Step into	step
Step over	next
Continue	continue
Print variable	print x
Stack trace	backtrace
Watch variable	watch x
Quit	quit
